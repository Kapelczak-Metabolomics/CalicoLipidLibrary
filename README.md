# CalicoLipidLibrary
Scripts to create in silico lipid fragmentation spectra, based on analysis of chemical standards and relevant scientific literature.

# Installation

1.  clone this repository.

2. `cd CalicoLipidLibrary`

3. `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`

# Examples

1. Generate an .msp file, with classes and adducts of interest:

This is the primary usage of this package.  Produce an msp file for all desired/classes and adducts, like so:

`TODO`

2. Print spectrum of lipid of interest

Running python in an interactive shell, you may also print the theoretical MS/MS spectrum of a single lipid class+adduct:

`TODO`
